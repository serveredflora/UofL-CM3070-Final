# CM3070 - Final Project

> Rogue-like Urban Scavenger Game

## Resources Used

- [TriInspector](https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Tri-Inspector) (MIT License)
  - Provides attributes to create more powerful inspector tooling. Used heavily throughout the project to provide more validation and functionality to the inspector
- [PrimeTween](https://github.com/KyryloKuzyk/PrimeTween) (MIT License)
  - Provides "tweening" values across time through various options. Has much of the Unity-API covered, but also allows for the user to do custom tweening. Used for various UI and visual elements
- [Kenney Food Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/food-kit) (Creative Commons CC0)
  - Mesh/texture assets for various food items. Used as meshes for the player to scavenge in the procedurally generated urban environment. 

> Note: the following assets have been removed from the project as they are paid assets from the Unity Store, which prohibits redistribution of paid content. These were used purely to aid in development and didn't have an impact in an exported build of the project.

- [ALINE](https://arongranberg.com/aline/) (Unity Asset Store License, Paid)
  - Provides more debug drawing utilities for both development and/or runtime usage. Used during the development and testing of the procedural generation as it provides far more options for debug drawing (eg. text!). The remaining usage's of asset have been commented out
- [Hot Reload for Unity](https://hotreload.net/) (Unity Asset Store License, Paid)
  - Provides hot reload compilation for various changes made in C# code in a transparent way (no code/API calls required)
